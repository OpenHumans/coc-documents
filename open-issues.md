## Power Structure for Code of Conduct enforcement

In most communities, there is a set of leaders who guide the community
direction. Typically, a person or a set of people have the final say in any
disagreements or proposed changes. In some communities, that could be the
maintainers for the project or a non-profit foundation board. For events, that
might be the event organizers. Sometimes when a Code of Conduct committee makes
a decision, the involved parties may want to appeal to that higher authority.

 - What is the name for the ultimate authority in the community?

Usually, a subset of those leaders, or an appointed committee,
is in charge of deciding how to handle Code of Conduct violations.

 - How are Code of Conduct committee members chosen?

 - What is done to ensure that the committee is representative of the diversity
   Open Humans wants to see in their community? Please consider diversity along
   all protected classes, not just gender.

 - What is done to ensure that the governing body that has power and authority
   over the financial or technical direction of the community is separate from
   the Code of Conduct committee?

 - How long will committee members serve?

 - What is the process for replacing committee members?
